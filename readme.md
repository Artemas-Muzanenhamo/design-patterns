# Design Patterns

## Why learn patterns?

- A means of communicating a problem to another developer.
- It's a common vocabulary which allows you to explain a common problem.
- Abstract topic so the more experience you have programming the more you'll
need to revisit these patterns.

## Pattern Groups

The Gang of Four breaks patterns into 3 groups which are:

- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

## What Patterns

The patterns that fall under the Creational group are:

- Singleton Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- AbstractFactory Pattern

## How do we learn them?

We will break down the overview of the pattern, followed by looking at the 
concept of the pattern and also when we would choose to use the pattern. We will 
then look at what you'll need to consider as the design and then we will look at 
the pitfalls of the design pattern. We will also contrast it with another pattern.
